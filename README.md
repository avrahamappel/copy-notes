# Usage

Run from the command line:

```bash
copy-notes path/to/file/notes.jpg
```

A `notes-text.txt` file will be created with the results of the image scan in the same directory as the source image that you supplied.

You can also pass a target file path as a second parameter.

```bash
copy-notes path/to/file/notes.jpg ~/Notes/notes.txt
```

# Installation (Composer)

```bash
composer global require appel/copy-notes
```

Happy copying! üìù
